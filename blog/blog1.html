								<p>&ldquo;<strong> More great people have achieved their greatest success just one step beyond their greatest failure.</strong>&rdquo;- <strong>Napoleon Hill</strong></p>
								<p><span>Each and every human in this world is destined for success, though the definition of success is rather distinct from each individual&rsquo;s perspective. One can never accomplish victory without committing a million missteps. Those mistakes are the primitives from which the road to triumph is constructed.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">For your easy understanding, let&rsquo;s take an example of a Butterfly. It&rsquo;s not an easy job for a caterpillar to turn into butterfly. After, a caterpillar forms a cocoon; it has to go through&nbsp; a lot more.&nbsp; </span></p>
								<p ><span>&nbsp;A butterfly has to struggle its way out of the cocoon. It takes several hours for a butterfly to break its way out of the cocoon.</span></p>
								<p ><span>But, the restricting cocoon and the struggle required for the butterfly to get through the tiny opening are nature's way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into its wings so that it will be ready for flight once it achieves its freedom from the cocoon.</span></p>
								<p><span>In the same way, sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our life. If nature allowed us to go through your life without any obstacles, it would cripple us. We would not be as strong as what we could have been. And we could never fly&hellip;. </span></p>
								<p><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
								<p><strong><span>&ldquo;Nothing is ever easy as long as you keep on trying&rdquo;&nbsp; </span></strong></p>
								<p><span>Relishing the triumph at first shot is not a cakewalk. The endless struggle will sculpt you enough to become a magnificent deity. The tribulations hit you, smash you, experiment you and finally you owe the prosperity of it. The liabilities for each attempts, will manifold your assets. Plentiful trials will Reform you into a vanquisher.</span></p>
								<p><strong><span>&ldquo;Trials make you strong, Tribulations make you strive, Triumphs keep you going and growing.&rdquo;</span></strong></p>
								<p><span>It&rsquo;s all about learning every day, every step and at every point where you fall. Learning and rectification of mistakes, constitute the winning phase. Success is understanding, that losing battles can help you win a war. The path may have many crests and troughs, despite which you have to be iron-willed to acknowledge your dream. Progressive achievements are relatively reciprocal to the efforts. Continuous efforts, with the burning desire to reach your yearning destiny is quite essential for accomplishing something extraordinary. </span></p>
								<p><span>People who turn their struggle into success are the ultimate illustration to the human spirit. The path is multi-faceted, a myriad of strengths, traits and </span><span>behaviour</span>s <span>are involved. This world always has two polarities, North-South, East-West, Up-Down, Positive- Negative and more. Every single circumstance has both positive and negative. The absolute affirmative note leads to triumph, moving against tribulations. Pain is inevitable for victory. Suffering is an integral and a crucial element of a successful story. Affliction shadows the ramble to your goal.</span></p>
								<p><span>The human mentality believes negatives soon, which are extremely contagious. Small minded people scare you and discourage you from chasing your dreams. These people tend to instil fear in you. A strong, resilient immunity to these minds, set you on your quest for success. Strive hard for reaching your objective. </span></p>
								<p><span>Hope is your only dope to conquest. The rewards for strife is flying high in ranges of colours. You need to understand that, failure is also a part of success. It&rsquo;s the foremost print to triumph.</span></p>
								<p><span>Becoming triumphant in life is not such an easy task, there might come a situation where the whole cosmos might stand against, what you believe is ethical. In such a circumstance it is incredibly essential to take a stand for yourself. </span></p>
								<p><span>As the famous saying goes &ldquo;<strong>Rock bottom is the solid foundation from which one rebuilds themselves&rdquo;</strong> without committing mistakes and facing hardships one can never learn anything at all, for mistakes are proof that you are trying to achieve and hardships pave the way to prosperity. Just like stars cannot shine without darkness, one cannot legitimately Triumph without a certain measure of Trials and Tribulations.</span></p>
